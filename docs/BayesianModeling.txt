1. Introduction to Bayesian A/B Testing 🌌


Bayesian A/B Testing offers an alternative, highly intuitive approach to hypothesis testing compared to the frequentist methods (T-test, Chi-Square). Instead of asking "What is the probability of seeing this data if there is no effect?" (the P-value), Bayesian analysis answers the direct business question: "What is the probability that the new thumbnail (Treatment) is actually better than the old one (Control)?"
This method uses the Beta-Binomial Conjugate Prior to model the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of each group as a Beta distribution.
* Prior: The initial belief about the CTR before seeing the data. A weak prior, Beta(2, 10), was used, assuming a baseline CTR of 2/2+10 = 16.67% with low confidence.
* Likelihood: The observed data (clicks/non-clicks).
* Posterior: The updated belief about the CTR after incorporating the data, calculated as Beta(alpha_{prior} + {Successes}, beta_{prior} + {Failures}).

2. Posterior Distributions and Test Results




A. Posterior Parameters


The calculation uses the following observed data (based on the original data generation output and the script logic):
* Control: 633 successes (clicks) / 5076 trials.
* Treatment: 781 successes (clicks) / 4924 trials.
Group
	Successes
	Failures
	Prior (α,β)
	Posterior (αpost​,βpost​)
	Control
	633
	5076 - 633 = 4443
	(2, 10)
	Beta(635,445)
	Treatment
	781
	$4924 - 781 = 4143$
	$(2, 10)$
	Beta(783,4153)
	

B. Bayesian Results


The analysis uses 100,000 samples from these posterior distributions to calculate the key metrics.
Metric
	Value
	Interpretation
	Probability that treatment is better
	1.0000 (100.0%)
	The probability that the true CTR of the new thumbnail is higher than the old one. This result is overwhelming.
	Mean improvement
	0.0338
	The expected difference in CTR between the treatment and control groups (3.38 percentage points).
	95% Credible Interval (CI)
	[0.0202,0.0475]
	There is a 95% probability that the true difference in CTR is between 2.02 and 4.7 percentage points.
	Expected loss if we choose treatment
	0.000000
	The expected cost (in lost clicks) if we incorrectly launch the treatment. A value of zero means there is virtually no risk in choosing the new thumbnail.

3. Analysis of Bayesian Visualizations 🖼️


The visualization provides a powerful, intuitive summary of the results .


A. Plot 1: Posterior Distributions of CTR (Left)


* The two Beta distributions (blue for Control, orange for Treatment) are perfectly separate, with no overlap.
* The Control distribution is centered around 0.125(12.5%).
* The Treatment distribution is centered around 0.159(15.9%).
* The lack of overlap visually confirms the 100.00% probability that the treatment's true CTR is higher than the control's.


B. Plot 2: Distribution of Treatment Effect (Right)


* This is the distribution of the difference (Treatment CTR} - Control CTR).
* The entire green histogram is located to the right of the red dashed line (Difference = 0), meaning all sampled values showed a positive lift.
* The Mean difference (blue solid line) is at 0.0338.
* The visualization powerfully demonstrates that zero difference is not a credible outcome.

4. Comprehensive Conclusion and Final Recommendation ✅


All phases of the A/B test analysis converge on the same conclusion:
1. Exploratory Analysis (Phase 2): Showed a clear visual lift for the Treatment group and confirmed strong randomization (except for a small imbalance in previous watchers).
2. Frequentist Statistics (Phase 3): Concluded the lift was highly statistically significant (P approx 0.000001).
3. Advanced Modeling (Phase 4): Provided a robust, adjusted odds ratio, confirming the significance while controlling for the detected covariate imbalance.
4. Bayesian Inference (Phase 5): Provided the ultimate confidence measure: a 100.00% probability that the new thumbnail is better, with an expected lift of 3.38 percentage points and an expected loss of 0.
Final Recommendation: Based on the unanimous and overwhelming evidence across all statistical methodologies, the new thumbnail (Treatment) should be deployed immediately and permanently. The test is conclusive.
