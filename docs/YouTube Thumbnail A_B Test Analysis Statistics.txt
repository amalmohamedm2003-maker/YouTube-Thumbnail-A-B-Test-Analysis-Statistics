Executive Summary 📋


This report synthesizes the results of a six-phase A/B test analysis comparing a Control (Old Thumbnail) to a Treatment (New Thumbnail) to measure its impact on Click-Through Rate (CTR). The analysis, encompassing descriptive statistics, frequentist inference, advanced modeling, and Bayesian methods, unanimously concludes that the New Thumbnail is statistically and practically superior.
Despite detecting a minor randomization imbalance in user demographics, the results were validated using Logistic Regression to produce an Adjusted Odds Ratio of 1.4128, confirming the robustness of the effect.
Final Recommendation: Immediately implement the new thumbnail. The expected benefit is 33,906 extra clicks per 1 million views.

Phase 1: Data Generation and Initial Metrics 💾


This initial phase involved creating a synthetic dataset representing a simulated two-week A/B test on a YouTube channel.


1.1. Dataset Structure


The dataset contains 10,000 users and 6 features.
Feature Name
	Type

1.2. Descriptive Metrics


The randomization resulted in a near 50/50 split between groups, validating the initial test setup.

	-

	Relative Improvement
	-
	+27.19%
	The initial results showed a clear observed lift of 27.19% in favor of the new thumbnail.

Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Randomization Check 🔍


The EDA phase focused on visualizing the observed lift and rigorously validating the randomization across key covariates.


2.1. Visualization Findings


* CTR by Group: A bar chart confirmed the Treatment CTR 15.86% was visibly higher than the Control CTR 12.47%.
* Age and Country Distribution: Histograms and bar charts showed that the distributions of age and country were virtually identical between the control and treatment groups, indicating successful randomization for these demographics.
* Previous Channel Watchers: The initial visual check suggested balance, but formal testing was required.
________________


Phase 3: Frequentist Statistical Inference & Imbalance Detection 📊


Formal statistical tests were applied to determine the likelihood that the observed $3.39$ percentage point difference was due to random chance.


3.1. Primary Test Results


Both the Independent T-Test and the Chi-Square Test returned highly significant P-values, allowing for the rejection of the null hypothesis (H_0: No difference in CTR).
| Test | Statistic | P-value (P>|z|) | Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| T-test | 4.8703 | 0.000001 | H_A is supported; Significant Lift. |
| Chi-Square | 23.3896 | 0.000001 | Independence is rejected; Groups differ significantly. |


3.2. Covariate Balance Check (Data Quality Note)


Formal frequentist tests confirmed the initial EDA findings, but flagged one variable as imbalanced, necessitating advanced modeling.
Covariate
	Test
	P-value
	Conclusion
	Age
	T-test
	0.1459
	Balanced (P > 0.05)
	Country
	Chi-Square
	0.227
	Balanced (P > 0.05)
	Previously Watched
	Chi-Square
	0.0275
	IMBALANCED (P < 0.05)
	The Control Group was found to have a statistically higher proportion of previous watchers (30.0% vs. 27.9% in Treatment). Since previous watchers typically click more, this imbalance biases the naive CTR against the Treatment Group, suggesting the true effect might be even larger.

Phase 4: Advanced Modeling (Logistic Regression) 🎯


Logistic Regression was employed to formally control for the covariate imbalance and provide an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect. This is done by modeling Probability(text{Click}) =is_treatment + covariates.


4.1. Adjusted Treatment Effect


The model successfully isolated the pure impact of the new thumbnail:
| Metric | Coefficient (Log-Odds) | P-value (P>|z|)| Adjusted Odds Ratio (exp({coef})) | 95% Confidence Interval |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| is_treatment | 0.2791 | 0.000 | 1.4128 | [1.2765, 1.5621] |
* Interpretation: After adjusting for differences in age, country, and previous watch status, the Treatment Group still has 41.28% higher odds of clicking than the Control Group.
* Confidence: The entire 95% Confidence Interval is above 1.0, reaffirming the statistical significance of the result in an unbiased manner.


4.2. Covariate Effect


The logistic regression confirmed that previously_watched_channel is indeed a factor, with an Odds Ratio of 1.0687 (6.87% higher odds of clicking for previous watchers), demonstrating the model's success in controlling for this feature.

Phase 5: Bayesian Inference 🔮


Bayesian A/B testing was performed using the Beta-Binomial conjugate model to calculate the direct probability of the treatment being superior, providing a highly intuitive measure of confidence.


5.1. Posterior Distributions


The observed successes and failures updated the prior distribution ($\text{Beta}(2, 10)$) to the following posterior distributions:
* Control Posterior: Beta(635, 4453)
Treatment Posterior:Beta(783, 4153)
These distributions, when plotted, show no overlap, visually confirming the treatment's superiority .


5.2. Bayesian Confidence Metrics


Metric
	Value
	Interpretation
	Probability that treatment is better
	0.9998 (99.98%})
	The near-certainty that the new thumbnail's true CTR is higher.
	Mean Improvement
	0.0338
	Expected lift of 3.38 percentage points.
	95% Credible Interval
	[0.0202, 0.0475]
	95% chance the true lift is between 2.02 and 4.7 percentage points.
	Expected Loss
	0.000000
	Virtually no risk of lost clicks by choosing the new thumbnail.

Phase 6: Final Business Recommendation ✅


The synthesis of all analytical phases provides a definitive conclusion.


6.1. Final Conclusion


The test results are conclusive and robust: the new thumbnail significantly improves CTR. The advanced modeling successfully mitigated the risk associated with the observed covariate imbalance, confirming that the Treatment Group's success is due to the thumbnail, not a fluke in user assignment.


6.2. Actionable Recommendation


* Decision: Implement the new thumbnail (Treatment).
* Risk Assessment: LOW. All statistical confidence measures (P-value, Adjusted CI, Bayesian Probability) strongly support the decision.
* Projected Impact: The observed 3.39 percentage point absolute lift translates to an estimated 33,906 additional clicks for every 1 million views the video receives.
